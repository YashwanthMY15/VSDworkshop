Task 1: Task is to refer to C based and RISCV based lab videos and execute the task of compiling the C code using gcc and riscv compiler

# C Language based LAB
# C and RISC-V Based Labs

This repository demonstrates the processes involved in compiling C programs and generating assembly code using both a standard GCC compiler and a RISC-V GCC compiler. It includes comprehensive steps and explanations to guide users through each stage of the compilation and debugging workflow.

## C Language-Based Lab

### Steps to Compile a .c File on Your Machine:

1. Open the bash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your file.
2. Use the following command to create and edit a new .c file:
   sh
   leafpad sum1ton.c


### Steps to Compile a .c File on our Machine:
 sh
 gcc sum1ton.c
 ./a.out


 
 # Compilation and execution complete.

## RISC-V Based Lab

### Steps to Compile Using RISC-V GCC Compiler:
1. Ensure the RISC-V GCC compiler is installed and accessible on your system.
2. Verify the .c file contents using the cat command:
   sh
   cat sum1ton.c


3. Compile the C program for RISC-V architecture using 01 option:
 sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c

4. Disassemble the object file to view its assembly code using:
 sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o

5.minimize the assembly by using following code:
sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less

 a)we extract main function's assembly code by using:
   sh
/main

6. Use /main in the terminal to locate the main function in the assembly output.

7.Compile the C program for RISC-V architecture using ofast option:
sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c

8.Disassemble the object file to view its assembly code using:
sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o

9.minimize the assembly by using following code:
sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less

 a)we extract main function's assembly code by using:
 sh
  /main

10. Use /main in the terminal to locate the main function in the assembly output.

### Explanation of Key Commands and Options: 
1. -mabi=lp64: Specifies the Application Binary Interface (ABI) for 64-bit integers, pointers, and long data types, suitable for 64-bit RISC-V architecture.

2. -march=rv64i: Indicates the 64-bit RISC-V base integer instruction set architecture.

3. -O1: Enables basic optimization for better performance without significantly increasing compilation time.

4. -Ofast: Optimize the code aggressively for the best possible speed.

5. riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump: A tool for disassembling RISC-V binaries to examine the code structure and debug it effectively.
